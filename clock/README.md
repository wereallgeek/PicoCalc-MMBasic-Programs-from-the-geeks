# [CLK.BAS](https://github.com/wereallgeek/PicoCalc-MMBasic-Programs-from-the-geeks/blob/main/clock/clk.bas) - Simple analog clock for PicoCalc

## tinkering with MMBasic and programs

I had no formal clock for picomite, and didn't find any online. Almost. Found one for MMBasic and decided to begin there.

## disclaimer
This software is for fun.

Use at your own risk.

But have fun.

## Credits

The very base for this software (before modification) was found online at this location.

I made minor alterations (removed backlight LED pin control) and it worked. This was the base for the current software. Thanks a lot to nbrok a.k.a Nick de pe1goo

## instructions
The program runs with local time. Hopefully a RTC will be added to my maching and render this actually useful.
