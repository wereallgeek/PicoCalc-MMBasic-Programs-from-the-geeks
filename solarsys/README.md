## tinkering with MMBasic and programs

While looking for a (normal) calendar for the PicoCalc, I stumbled upon a Solar system Calendar for MMBasic/PicoMite

I decided to do the minimal adaptation required to make this work on the picocalc


## disclaimer
This is only a conversion from 320x240 to 320x320 and removal of touch-screen in favour to keyboard. The hard work has been done before my involvement.

Thanks to [Raspberry Pi Forums] (https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=325534) which took the initial program (in microPython) from [Git] (https://github.com/dr-mod/pico-solar-system)

These small projects are fun to have.

enjoy.



## instructions
The program will display the solar system. Here are the keypresses

+      = Brightness up

-      = Brightness down

,<     = increase date by a week at a time then a month...

.>     = decrease date by a week at a time then a month...

<-Back = reset back to todays date, also re-initialise LCD display

ESC    = Exit program
